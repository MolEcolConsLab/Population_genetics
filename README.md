# Population_genetics

This GitHub repository contains code for population genetics to produce PCA plots, DAPC plots, Fst, IBD, and genetic distance metrics from a filtered VCF file. Plans for the near future include streamlining the code and improving computation time, as well as adding relatedness calculations and additional QC.
