# Population_genetics

This GitHub page contains a population genetics workflow for producing PCA plots, DAPC plots, and genetic distance metrics from a filtered VCF file. The scripts are in their early stages, but plans for the near future include streamlining the code and improving computation time, as well as adding relatedness calculations, IBD, and fineRADstructure.
